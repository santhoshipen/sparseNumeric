Description: Provides an S4 class for representing sparse numeric vectors 
    using only non-zero values and their positions. Includes methods for 
    arithmetic operations, coercion between sparse and dense formats, 
    vector standardization, Euclidean norm calculation, plotting, and 
    additional utilities for efficient sparse vector manipulation.
